# Free project 1

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

A DSL made for the daily intelecual who wants a better way to store personalbe information easily such as books/locations of owned books in a collection, reports, websites and other knowledge that is personalble to ones self. This DSL may incldude such a laguage that allows for easy input, recovery, and autaomitic storage and organization. 
### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

This laguage would aim to help the need for those who struggle to keep track of their personalble knowlege. Right now people use a collection of accumaltive apps such as notepad, zoetero, passward apps, and other note based collections. If such a DSL existed it would have the capability for people to store all of this info securley within one place. It would allow for easy acces to the info as well as easy storage. 

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

How many times a day to you say hey thats interesting or hey I need to remember this for later or you struggle to remember where you stored a password/peice of info. This language would allow the user to instanly store whatever they needed into a data base through a hopfully simple language on their phone or computer. For instace userA wants to remeber where they stored a book in their book collection of 100+ books. UserA could use the language by simply typing the name of the book/author to recover the infomation that is stored about the book in the data base. Another example UserB is a teacher and wants to keep track of a particular website for their students to use in years to come. Inseated of putting the website in a google app of some kind she can use the language to keep track of it the database.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

What excites me about this language is its ability to communicate with data bases and its ability to adapt change and build on top of a data base. I feel like data bases are a growing feild and having a langauge that allows for quick and affective storage could be very versitile in the industry. I came up with this idea after our interveiw with one of the professors at Mudd and have continued to think about its possibilites with regards to my own expirence in the industry. 

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

accessable langauge for quick/affective Information storage

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

My though would be that the language would be a combination of a natural language and an optional coding like langauge. For instance users that want to use this aplication for personal knowlegde such as books, reports, websites ect... would have thia ablity to use either a phone or computer to efforlessly say something like " store book "title of book" "anything else they deem important about the book such as location in collection" " where the language would use precise key words to do an action. Additionally, mayble this language presents itself more useful for database programers that have to phisicallycode the database with the type of information to be stored, how much space to use, or other data base process that have to be completed each time you build a database. In this example we could have a DSL that still works roughly the same as above but may allow for more coding ability such as add, recover, delete, and edit funcftions. This would allow for programers to get rid of most of their set up and hard coding of the data base and move into just the what do I want to do with it phase. 
### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

lets say the user wants to store information they may use a key word such as store or save ... The laguange would see the keyword and automaticcly go through the process of setting up a data base. Lets also say they wanted to save a book and maybe we have a keyword for book, this would allow the system to start a category within the dabase for books with additional automation. once the users request is put through it would comunicate back with a success or fail message where the fail message may be because of an operational issue or maybe becuase the language used by the user did not mach the specifations of the DSL.

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy for the user to put, gather, and edit info within a database through a limited key word language. This shoud be possible but may be difficult to program effectivly. I dont believe anything within this project would be impossible but the natural langauge component to actual process in real time with automation may be more difficult. In the sence that when a keyword is detected the program is basically writing a file for a database auomaticaly instead of the user or programmer. 

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

I do not think there is a language for this specifically. There are databases and storage tools such as notes, zotero, online databases, and much more. But functionality wise there are no laguanges that allow for new info to be stored upon user request affectivly and easily with minimal user actions. 

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I feel like this language would require a lot of work in both domains. The work would require code that is more key word/ natural langauge based which would be alot in themsleves. additionally it would require that each action of a keyword be brought to life through automated functionality within the domain of database set up. 

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I think this idea is pretty big. It would require students to have to know how data bases work and how to set them up through programing. 

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

I think this idea would be something very cool and versatile for both knoweldge seekers and database users in the industry. I think It would save a lot of time for both parties in terms of being able to store information affectivly. However, With technology expanding and the limited time within this course such an idea may only ever remain an idea. Also it would be complex to build and people may be just fine with their typical knowledge storage tools.
